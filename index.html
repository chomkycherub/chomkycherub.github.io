        <h3>Nuna</h3>
        <p>Nuna is a childlike fable about dreams and the world within. It is also an in-development pixel art RPG
            where a bear-like child will awake from slumber to discover a fantasy world moved by that which animates our
            deepest imaginations, our oniric shores - that one thing that cannot be explained, yet we live through.

            Inspired profoundly by Undertale and Yume Nikki, Nuna is currently under development ʕ -ᴥ•ʔ♡</p>

        <h3>Bronwyn</h3>
        <p>Bronwyn means the return of the feminine beyond death. It is an ever-changing entity emerged from the swampy waters
            of old, Hamlet's Ophelia reborn. She is also a lone poet's own creation, that exists forever trapped into Irreality.
            Inspired by Spanish poet J.E. Cirlot's Bronwyn saga, here lies Bronwyn, waiting to be reborn.

    <div class="project-card">
        <img src="images/samael.png" alt="Blood Covenant"> <!-- Assuming you meant to include a file extension here -->
        <h3>Blood Covenant</h3>
        <p>Blood Covenant is a bullet hell nightmare done in 3 days with partners Mateo and Laura from the THU programme for the 2024 TODO Game Jam.
            I was in charge of the game design when it comes to narrative, some art and animation, and music production as well.
            The picture depicts the final boss arena, where you fight Samæl, in Hebrew "Blindness of God", who's trying to stop you from committing
            deicide, as you are possessed by an ancient female demon, named Hæla.

        <h3>Mirrored Flesh</h3>
        <p>Mirrored Flesh is a 1.5bit Metroidvania prototype developed in Unity for my Master's Degree in Videogame Programming & Design at Universidad Oberta de Catalunya.
            Play as the demigod sisters Waleria and Magdala, guide your steps through the elderly forests where the Relics of the Mother lie hidden. 
            
            Waleria incarnates Goddess Diana, she can be seen through pearly reflections in the night, her blow firing silver death.
            Magdala, knighthearted, her armour by a burning ember inflamed. Her swords open path to an origin unthought.
            
            You can see the functioning of the prototype and a bit about the developing process in YouTube!
